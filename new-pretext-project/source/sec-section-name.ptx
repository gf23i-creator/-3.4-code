      <title>Distance and the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
      <p>
        Calculations for finding distances in elementary geometry rely on two primary useful facts: the <b>Pythagorean Theorem</b> and the formulas for the <b>circumference and area of a circle</b> [1].
      </p>

          Geometric formulas allow for the calculation of speed and perimeter in circular motion [2].

          <title>Speed of the Hurl-O-Matic</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              An aerial view of the "Hurl-O-Matic" carnival ride shows a car attached to the end of a 53-foot arm that rotates around a central hub [2]. If the car completes one full revolution in 15 seconds, calculate its speed in miles per hour (rounded to the nearest tenth) [2]. Note that 5280 feet equals 1 mile [2].

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              First, calculate the distance of one revolution using the circumference formula: <m>2 \cdot \pi \cdot 53\text{ ft} = 333.01\text{ feet}</m> [3]. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Determine the speed in feet per second: <m>333.01\text{ ft} / 15\text{ sec} = 22.2\text{ feet per second}</m> [3].
            </p>
            <p>
              To convert to miles per hour [3]:
              <ul>
                <li>Multiply by 60 to find feet per minute: <m>22.2 \times 60 = 1,332\text{ ft/min}</m>.</li>
                <li>Multiply by 60 again for feet per hour: <m>1,332 \times 60 = 79,920\text{ ft/hr}</m>.</li>
                <li>Divide by 5280 feet per mile: <m>79,920 / 5280 = 15.14\text{ mph}</m>.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

        Participants select three locations in Tallahassee: a starting point (Building X) and two others (Location A and Location B) [16]. After determining the distances between these points (Building X to A, Building X to B, and A to B), participants share only the first two distances with a classmate [16].

      <p>
        Classmates then attempt to map the set of all possible points for Location A and Location B [16]. If Location A is due north and Location B is due east from Building X, the Pythagorean Theorem can determine the distance between A and B [17]. Students should discuss the minimum and maximum possible values for this third distance based on the provided information [17].
